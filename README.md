# Predicting the rent prices of various houses based on different variable features
Making accurate predictions for rental prices of houses based on factors such as neighbourhood, longitude, latitude, and room type can greatly benefit hosts in determining the most profitable price to charge. By analyzing these key features, we can better understand the factors that influence demand for rental properties. Our machine learning system will provide hosts with recommendations for setting optimal prices, resulting in a more satisfying experience for them and increased profitability for Airbnb. As a result, many hosts will likely rely on the application to improve their earnings, thereby benefiting Airbnb as a whole.
